### *Changes are predictable*

Because of the single responsibility principle (one class == one style) it is easy to predict what removing or adding a class will do.
Scope is limited
There is no reliance on descendant/contextual selectors â€” styling is done inside "specificity layers".

### *CSS is clean*

There is very little redundancy and no dead weight (all styles are relevant to the project).
Components are portable
Classes used to style a component are not specific to that component, hence components can live in any other project that uses Atomizer [2].

### *Beginner-friendly*

Writing efficient and correct selectors is often one of the hardest parts of CSS for new developers to master. With Atomic CSS, developers don't create bloat because they don't write the selectors, instead they mostly re-use existing classes. This can greatly simplify the learning curve for inexperienced developers.
